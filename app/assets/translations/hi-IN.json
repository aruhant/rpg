    "lanka_dahan_intro": "As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting an amber glow over the ancient city of Lanka, you, Fearless Hanuman, found yourself ensnared. Ravana, the ten-headed demon king, had captured you—the mighty ape warrior. His eyes gleamed with malice as he spoke:\n\n“कपीनां किल लाङ्गूलमिष्टं भवति भूषणम्।\nतदस्य दीप्यतां शीघ्रं तेन दग्धेन गच्छतु।।5.53.3।।”\n\nTranslation: “The tail of a monkey is dear to them. It is like an ornament to them. Set it blaze swiftly with fire, and let him go.”\n\nBut you are Hanuman—the wind-swift, the leaper of oceans, the loyal servant of Lord Rama. You have the blessings of Maa Sita. \nThe flames would dance upon your fur, but it is as cold as ice.\nAs your heart beats with courage, and mischief twinkled in your eyes. \nYou would turn Lanka into an inferno, a beacon of defiance.\nCross the sprawling city, avoid detection, and unleash the flames of retribution. \n\nRemember, Fearless Hanuman, you have but one chance. If captured, the level resets. The city awaits your wrath, and Lanka trembles in anticipation.\n\nNote: Inspired by the epic Ramayana, this game level is a fictional adaptation.",
