# Ramayana: RPG & Platformer

This game allows the user to play through popular episodes of the Ramayana as one of its many unique characters.

## General Game and Game Mechanics & Physics

Many sub-episodes have fun minigames (obviously based on stories from the Ramayan), each with unique playstyles and objectives. We have tuned game physics and general mechanics to fit our characters and stories. For example, the different sprites are given unique affectations based on their Ramayana descriptions. Our gameplay involves many of the usual adventure-RPG components (like chests, potions, traps, etc.).

## Maps and Background

We have put in a lot of effort designing custom maps and structures based on locations from the Ramayan.


## Sprites

Play as heroes/heroine from the Ramayana (Lord Rama, Sita and Hanuman) navigating stories of the Ramayan, interacting with many additional characters, fighting against demons and finally Ravana.
