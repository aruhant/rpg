## Game Mechanics & AI

- Each level features custom gameplay mechanics based on the Ramayan episode, from solving puzzles to engaging in fast-paced combat.
- **Enemy AI**, for instance, uses ray-casting for realistic line-of-sight detection and collision-based proximity sensing. Many mini-bosses follow a Finite State Machine model (with defined behaviours like idle, attack, dodge, and retreat) and are even powered by LSTM-based predictive modelling. This provides an immersive combat like no other!

## Art & Environments

Each element in our game's visual world is crafted with care:

- **Hand-drawn animated sprites and backgrounds** all grounded in the Epic.
- **Environmental effects**, **shaders**, parallax scrolling, and **dynamic lighting**.
- Maps are designed based on locations from the Ramayan, offering familiar yet imaginative settings for each chapter.
